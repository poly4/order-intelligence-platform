   order details, and geographic data. Users are responsible for:
   - Complying with GDPR, CCPA, and applicable data protection regulations
   - Implementing appropriate data retention and deletion policies
   - Securing customer information during processing and storage
   - Obtaining necessary consents for data processing

2. **Operational Data Security**: The software handles warehouse operational data
   including dispatch schedules, performance metrics, and efficiency calculations.
   Users must:
   - Implement appropriate access controls for sensitive operational data
   - Secure CSV files and data exports containing customer information
   - Monitor and audit data access in production environments
   - Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures

### Commercial Use and Enterprise Deployment

3. **Enterprise Licensing**: Organizations using this software for commercial
   warehouse operations acknowledge:
   - This software is provided "as-is" for warehouse management purposes
   - Users are responsible for testing and validation in their specific environment
   - No warranties are provided regarding operational efficiency improvements
   - Integration with existing warehouse management systems is user responsibility

4. **Performance Claims**: While the software includes efficiency improvement
   calculations (15-45% batch optimization), actual results may vary based on:
   - Warehouse layout and operational procedures
   - Order volume and product mix
   - Staff training and system adoption
   - Integration with existing systems and workflows

### Third-Party Dependencies

5. **Open Source Components**: This software incorporates the following third-party
   open source components under their respective licenses:
   - Chart.js (MIT License) - https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js
   - Papa Parse (MIT License) - https://github.com/mholt/PapaParse
   - Leaflet.js (BSD 2-Clause License) - https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet

6. **CDN Dependencies**: The software references external CDN resources:
   - Users are responsible for ensuring CDN availability and security
   - Consider hosting dependencies locally for production environments
   - Monitor for security updates in all external dependencies

### Operational Disclaimer

7. **Warehouse Operations**: This software is designed to assist with warehouse
   operations but:
   - Should not be the sole system for critical dispatch decisions
   - Requires human oversight for final operational decisions
   - May need customization for specific warehouse environments
   - Should be tested thoroughly before production deployment

8. **Data Accuracy**: Users are responsible for:
   - Validating accuracy of CSV input data
   - Verifying calculation results in their operational context
   - Implementing appropriate quality control procedures
   - Maintaining accurate master data (postcodes, counties, product information)

### Support and Maintenance

9. **Community Support**: This is community-supported software:
   - No commercial support guarantees are provided
   - Users should contribute improvements back to the community
   - Documentation and bug reports help improve the software for all users
   - Enterprise users are encouraged to sponsor development efforts

10. **Updates and Security**: Users should:
    - Monitor for security updates and apply them promptly
    - Test updates in non-production environments before deployment
    - Implement monitoring and alerting for production systems
    - Have rollback procedures in place for failed updates

### Geographic and Regulatory Considerations

11. **UK-Specific Features**: This software includes UK-specific functionality:
    - UK postcode validation and geographic county mapping
    - Adjacency algorithms based on UK geography
    - Users outside the UK may need to modify geographic components
    - Validation patterns may need adjustment for other countries

12. **Regulatory Compliance**: Users must ensure compliance with:
    - Local warehouse safety regulations
    - Employment law regarding worker performance monitoring
    - Data protection regulations in their jurisdiction
    - Industry-specific compliance requirements (e.g., pharmaceutical, food)
